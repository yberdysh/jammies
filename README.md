# Jammies

Jammies was inspired by Magickal Tings, a group project built at Grace Hopper Academy. Magickal Tings was an e-commerce site that specialized in selling magical items and can be found under [this repo](https://github.com/Magikal-Noms/Magikal-Tings). Taking what I learned from this project, I decided to start an ongoing individual project with a fresh theme, and so Jammies was born. 

Jammies is an e-commerce site that specializes in selling the freshest, most delicious homemade jam. If you love fresh homemade jam, or if you find aesthetically pleasing as I do, then Jammies is for you!  Currently a work in progress, Jammies is built in the NERD stack with Express and Sequelize on the backend, and React and Redux on the front-end. 

_Please note that the site does not sell real jam, but is merely a mock of an e-commerce site_
